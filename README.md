This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on a Twitter dataset using TextBlob to extract sentiment parameters (polarity and subjectivity) from each tweet. The sentiment parameters will then be used as features for clustering the tweets into different groups using both Quantum Kmeans and Classical K-means algorithms simultaneously. After clustering, the accuracy of the clustered output will be evaluated using metrics. Additionally, real-time data points (new tweets) will be classified into existing clusters using both approaches, and their clusters will be visualized for comparison.
